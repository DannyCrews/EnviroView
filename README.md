A joint project with Dan Crews (github.com/dannycrews) and Matt Clement (github.com/darkmoves) in General Assembly's Web Development Immersive program.  

This is the second draft of https://github.com/DannyCrews/api_lab and contains https://github.com/abigezunt/heatmap.

After experimenting with d3 for map-making, we eventually used Google's Fusion Tables functionality and Leaflet's mapmaking library to generate these visualizations.
